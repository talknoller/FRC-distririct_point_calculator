# FRC-distririct_point_calculator
A simple python script that recives district event keys and returns how many district points each team in the district gets

if you don't know what an TBA auth key is, to use the blue alliance api you need an auth key, it's free to generate
all you need to do is to got to https://www.thebluealliance.com/account create an account if you don't have one and scroll down to Read API Keys.
you will see a green button that says add new key and a field which says description, write "dp_auth_key" and click the green button
the page will reset and you will see a long string of letters under the green button to the left, that's your auth key
simply copy it and past it where the script asks for an auth key

I wrote this in an afternoon so let me know if there are any issues with it
